## Chapter 5 - User Interface
> Done! You created first NSO Service - ACL Service!  
> Moreover - you can manage it from the Web Interface!  
> Sky is the limit! :partly_sunny:

**Network Engineers** are comfortable with the **CLI** but **Customers** doesn't really want to see the CLI in the XXI century. They would love to see customized **User Interface** and be able to configure network by clicking the button in the website.

In Carl's scenario - when he will be on his PTO - there will be no one in his company with enough networking knowledge to remove ACL_CLUS from the whole network of different devices. What if he will have **Use Interface** that will be able to remove all ACL_CLUS configs from all devices in the Network? Sounds great!

Carl is rescued!
